# Traffic-Sign-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for our Traffic Sign Detection project, a deep learning endeavor aimed at recognizing and classifying traffic signs. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), this project focuses on the accurate classification of road signs using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of a CNN model in TensorFlow and Keras to process and analyze image data efficiently.
- Use of advanced image preprocessing techniques to standardize and optimize data for neural network training.
- Application of the Adam optimizer for adaptive learning rates, ensuring efficient model training and convergence.
- Comprehensive model evaluation using accuracy metrics, precision, recall, and F1-scores for detailed performance analysis.
- Data visualization tools employed for insightful analysis of the model's training process and outcome.

**Technologies and Tools:**
- Python for scripting and model development.
- TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the deep learning model.
- Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib for generating visualizations of the model's training and evaluation metrics.


This project exemplifies the application of deep learning in the field of image recognition and serves as a practical approach to traffic sign detection, a critical component in the development of autonomous driving systems and advanced driver assistance systems.
